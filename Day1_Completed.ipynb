    "### Why Use Python in the Digital Humanities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has emerged as a key language in DH because it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Read and Write:** Python’s clean syntax makes it approachable, especially for scholars without a computer science background.\n",
    "- **Widely Supported:** Python has a vibrant global community and extensive online documentation, tutorials, and forums.\n",
    "- **Rich in Libraries:** There are many ready-to-use libraries for working with text, data, images, sound, and even geographic information.\n",
    "- **Flexible and Powerful:** Python can be used for small tasks like file renaming, or large-scale tasks like building full text analysis pipelines or interactive web applications.\n",
    "- **Interoperable:** Python can work with many different file formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON, PDF, images) and integrate with other tools commonly used in humanities research.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning Python, researchers in the humanities gain a set of tools to extend their traditional methods, handle complex datasets, and share their work in innovative and engaging ways."

    "## Introduction to JupyterLab\n",
    "JupyterLab is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used in data science, research, and education, especially for projects in the Digital Humanities, because of its flexibility and ease of use. JupyterLab is essentially an upgrade of Jupyter Notebooks, providing a more modular and feature-rich interface."

    "### Key Features of JupyterLab:\n",
    "- **Code cells:** These are cells where you write and execute code.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells:** These cells are used for explanatory text, formatted using Markdown.\n",
    "- **Rich outputs:** Visualizations, graphs, images, and other media can be displayed inline within the notebook.\n",
    "- **File management:** JupyterLab has a built-in file browser that allows you to organize and manage notebooks, text files, images, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Add Cells in JupyterLab\n",
    "In JupyterLab, cells are the building blocks of your notebook. You can add, delete, and modify cells to create a flow between code execution and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Cells:\n",
    "1. **Via Menu:** Navigate to the top menu: *Insert → Insert Cell Below or Insert → Insert Cell Above.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** *Press B* to insert a cell below the current one or *A* to insert a cell above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clicking Buttons:** Use the \"+\" button in the toolbar to insert new cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switching Between Cell Types (Code and Markdown):\n",
    "You can switch between code cells and markdown cells to organize your content effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **To Change a Cell Type to Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Select the cell and *press Y*.\n",
    "- Alternatively, click on the Cell Type dropdown menu in the toolbar (where \"Markdown\" is by default) and select Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **To Change a Cell Type to Markdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the cell and *press M*.\n",
    "- Alternatively, use the Cell Type dropdown and select Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to seamlessly switch between running code and writing descriptive text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running and Stopping Cells\n",
    "Cells in JupyterLab can either be run (executed) or stopped, depending on whether you want to see the result of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Running Cells:**\n",
    "To execute a cell, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows/Linux: Press *Shift + Enter* to run the current cell and move to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mac: Press *Shift + Enter* to run the current cell and move to the next. You can also use *command + Enter* to run the cell and stay in that cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, click the *Run* button in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stopping a Cell:**\n",
    "If you want to stop the execution of a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to *Kernel → Interrupt* in the top menu or use the Stop button in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut *I* twice (press I quickly two times) to interrupt the current execution."

    "\n",
    "#### Common Kernel Actions:\n",
    "1. **Run code:** Shift + Enter\n",
    "2. **Interrupt kernel:** Stop a running cell (especially useful if stuck on [*])\n",

    "### External Libraries\n",
    "While Python’s built-in libraries cover a lot, many advanced tasks require specialized tools, this is where external libraries come in. These are packages developed by the Python community (or companies) and shared through the Python Package Index (PyPI). You usually install them using the package manager *pip*.\n",

    "#### What Are External Libraries?\n",
    "- They extend Python’s capabilities beyond the standard library.\n",
    "- Provide tools for data science, machine learning, web development, image processing, automation, and much more.\n",
    "- They often come with many modules and sub-packages bundled together, making them powerful libraries.\n",

    "#### Choosing the Right Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the appropriate data structure is crucial. Here’s a quick guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Lists** when you need to store a collection of items that you might want to change or add to, like student grades over multiple subjects or assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Tuples** for fixed data points that won't change, such as geographic coordinates of research locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Dictionaries** when you need to associate related information together, such as all academic details for a specific student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right data structure will make your data management more efficient and your code easier to understand."
