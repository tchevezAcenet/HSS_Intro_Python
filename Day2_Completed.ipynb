    "2. **Global Variable (global_var):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- global_var is defined outside of any function, so it’s a global variable, accessible anywhere in the code.\n",
    "- Inside another_function(), we use print(global_var). Since global_var is global, this works even though it’s outside the function.\n",
